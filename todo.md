2. Limits on short URL's : We can add a certain limits on the short URL's added like :-
     * A particular short URL will expire after a certain time or after certain no of calls.
     * We can create a dashboard like thing for each shortUrl generated.
     * We can also keep a track of the IP addresses which accessed that url.
