1) Authentication : We can add authentication to our API's so as to prevent unwanted access.
                    * Username and Password Authentication
                    * Custom Authentication : OTP Based
                    * OAuth Authentication
                    * We can also add a user profile section from where he/she can have a look at all its generated URL's and also change its details.

2) Limits on short URL's : We can add a certain limits on the short URL's added like :-
                          * A particular short URL will expire after a certain time or after certain no of calls.
                          * We can create a dashboard like thing for each shortUrl generated.
                          * We can also keep a track of the IP addresses which accessed that url.
