The node.js app is used to generate a corresponding short url for the given long url.
Since this is just the version of this web app, it lacks some major features like authentications and a powerful UI.

What's a URL Shortener?
URL shortening is a technique to convert a long URL (site or page address) to a shorter version. This shorter version of the URL is usually cleaner and easier to share or remember. When someone accesses the shortened address, the browser redirects to the original (large) url address. It is also called URL redirection or URL redirect.

Stack Used :-

1. Node.js - One of the most efficient and most widely used backend architecture.
                Used as i have a very good command over it and it can handle multiple requests asynchronously.
    
2. ES
    
3. MongoDB - I used mongo DB as i needed only one table currently without the need of joins, and also i had
             no need to keep the data strictly structured. I would need frequent changes in database structure going forward hence i chose NoSQL because it is easier                  to deal with such cases.
    
4. HTML & CSS for UI - I created a very basic UI currently though we can switch to Angular or React going
                            forward
5. Modules such as express, dotenv, valid-url, short-id
